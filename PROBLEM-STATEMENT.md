## PS 3 - “AI Copilot for Data Teams” By Zingle AI

### Context and Impact
Data teams spend much of their time on repetitive, low-value tasks like writing boilerplate SQL queries, cleaning messy datasets, or manually creating dashboards. These tasks delay insights and decision-making, keeping business teams waiting. AI can transform this workflow by automating tedious steps, improving accuracy, and enabling faster, richer insights. A breakthrough here could significantly boost how organizations use data.

### PS - Your task is to build an AI-powered assistant or workflow that reduces the manual effort required in day-to-day data team operations.

Some example use cases include:
- Generating SQL or Python scripts automatically from natural language questions.
- Detecting and cleaning data quality issues (missing values, outliers, schema mismatches).
- Auto-building dashboards or visualizations from raw datasets.
- Summarizing and documenting datasets in plain English.
- Suggesting KPIs or metrics relevant to a given dataset.

These are only examples. We will value new, creative use cases that go beyond this list even more.
